<h1>UNSW Science Extension 2019 - Marine Heatwaves</h1>

Notebooks and data to investigate marine heatwave (MHW) statistics, change, drivers and impacts.

<h2>Demo Notebooks</h2>

The notebooks include worked examples on how to:

- **Marine_heatwaves_demo-1:** Read, plot and analyse data output from [MHW tracker](http://www.marineheatwaves.org/tracker.html)
- **Marine_heatwaves_demo-2:** Investigate the MHW drivers e.g., the role of El Niño–Southern Oscillation driving MHWs off the coast of Western Australia
- **Marine_heatwaves_demo-3 (draft version):** Investigates MHW impacts on coral bleaching
- **MHW_Impacts_Coral:** Investigates MHW impacts on coral bleaching using NOAA degree heating week (DHW) data
- **MHW_Impacts_1:** Investigates MHW biological impacts usingtistical tests and plots (e.g., using lobster count/size)
- **Climate change:** Investigate changes in MHW metrics over time
- **Python and Statistics Introduction:** Basic introduction to python, jupyter notebooks and statistical functions (dual tutorial for climate change and MHW student groups)

<h2>Data procressing scripts</h2>

- **marineHeatWaves.py:** Calculate MHWs from sea surface temperqature data using python
- **Create Nino3.4 and ONI index files.ipynb:** Calculate the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) from NOAA OISST satellite data
